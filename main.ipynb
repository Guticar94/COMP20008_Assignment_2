This act aims to provide a quick and cost-effective method for resolving disputes regarding payments under construction contracts. It helps to facilitate timely payments between constructors, contractors, and subcontractors, which can prevent disputes and ultimately improve the efficiency of the construction industry in Victoria. The Security of Payment Act is designed to promote fairness and transparency in the construction industry, benefiting all parties involved.
